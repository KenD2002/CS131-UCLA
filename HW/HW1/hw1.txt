Q4
    pattern matched a for h::t and then used List.append h (set_all_union t) to extract h from
    it and append it to the returned list

Q6
    checks if x == f(x), if so then return x. Elsewise we let x <- f(x) and repeat

Q7
    I originally don't want to make any help function, but I found it is really hard to express
    f^p (x) in its body. Thus, I made a help function apply_n_times for f^n (x), then similar to Q6

Q9
    7 helper functions:

    is_symbol_terminable checks if a symbol is of type T, or if symbol is already contained
        in the terminable_symbols

    is_rhs_all_terminable checks if the right hand side only contains terminable symbols, and 
        return true if so, false otherwise

    construct_terminable_symbol_list checks the element of rules (each rule) one-by-one and 
        see if its rhs only contains terminable symbols. If so, then append this rule's symbol
        on the lhs into terminable_symbol_list, and move on to the next rule. If not, then do 
        nothing  and move on to the next rule

    rules_with_terminable_symbol_list attaches the terminable symbol lists to the rules and 
        form a tuple for computed_fixed_point to use as its f, where the input and output types 
        are the same

    equal_terminable_symbols compares x and f(x) for computed_fixed_point's eq argument

    final_terminable_symbol_list gets all the terminable symbols

    remove_bad_rules checks rule by rule and see if its rhs only contains terminable symbols.
        If not, then a blind alley would occur, and we have to remove this rule
    


    Then, filter_blind_alleys matches g to get its rules, and we get all the terminable symbols
        in this grammar, and then we remove all the bad rules that may cause blind alley
